Tools include _parse_ , _sort_, _dedup_. _parse_ considers various ligation types and properly reports contact pairs. Outputs a tab-separated [.pairs](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/pairix/blob/master/pairs_format_specification.md) file (with header) with contact coordinates and additional information, can be converted into a binned contact matrix using cooler. _parse2_ handles multiple ligation events (multi-way contacts, PORE-C and MC-3C technologies), better handles newer sequencing data. _dedup_ handles imperfect matches, can consider additional columns. Additional preprocessing tools: _flip_, _header_, _select_, _sample_, _merge_. Quality control tools: _scaling_ and _stats, calculate chromosome-specific decay rate of interaction frequencies with distance, additional stats. Protocol-specific tools (_restrict_ for annotating pairs by restriction fragments, _phase_ for annotating haplotype-resolved Hi-C, _filterbycov_ for cleaning up single-cell Hi-C).

- [HiConfidence](https://github.com/victorykobets/HiConfidence) - Python tool for eliminating biases from the Hi-C data by downweighting chromatin contacts from low-quality (low-coverage) Hi-C replicates. For each replicate, calculate differential matrix and then the confidence for each pixel as the inverse pixel-wise difference divided by their mean, raised to the power of a tunable parameter k (Figure 2A). Used for correction for replicates' confidence in calculating TAD boundaries, intra-TAD densities, improves replicate reproducibility (stratum-adjusted correlation coefficient). Compared with multiHiCcompare, aids in differential analysis, compartment and TAD detection.

## Differential analysis

- Evaluating 25 ways to compare Hi-C and Micro-C maps, experimental (HFF and ESC cells) and in silico-generated (Akita, CTCF insertion, deletion, random deletions). Global methods (Spearman correlation, Mean Square Error, Structural Similarity Index) and contact map methods (Arrowhead, CHESS, Contact direct, dcHiC, diffHiC, Distance enrichment, Eigenvector, FIND, HiC DC+, HiC1Dmetrics, HiCcompare, HiCExplorer, HOMER, Insulation, Loops, SCC, Selfish, SnapHiC-D, TADcompare, TADs, Triangle, ZipHiC).

</details>

- Benchmarking of 11 methods for Hi-C map comparisons (Figure 1 outlines comparison goals and method classification). Basic methods (mean square error (MSE), Pearson/Spearman/Stratum-adjusted correlation, Structural similarity index), Map-informed methods (Eigenvector differences, directionality index, insulation differences, contact probability decay, triangle profiles), Feature-informed methods (cooltools TAD calling, HiCCUPS loop calling, overlap of functional genomics data). MSE and Spearman report different similarity properties (MSE is sensitive to intensity and Spearman is not). Directionality index performs best in identifying focal changes, like the loss of loops, while contact decay, eigenvector and insulation differences prioritize global changes. Basic methods are sensitive to technical variations (noise, resolution). Tested on experimental (ESC and HFF cells) and 22,500 in silico generated (unperturbed 1Mb sequences and with random 100bp structural variations, CTCF motif insertions/deletions, maps predicted with Akita) contact maps.

Review of 1D metrics, such as PC1, directionality index (DI), insulation score (IS), separation score (SS), contrast index (CI), distal-to-local ratio (DLR) and inter-chromosomal fraction of interactions (Figure 1, Methods). Newly developed intra-TAD score (IAS) and inter-TAD score (IES) (detection of stripes, asymmetric 5'/3' stripe TADs, loope, others), adjusted interaction frequency (IF) (detection of hubs, among others), directional relative frequency (DRF) for two-sample comparison, detects directional TADs (5'/3' dTADs) depicting an asymmetric event of inter-TAD interactions. New metrics can be compared between matrices, used for clustering, examples on experimental data. Novel observations, e.g., the upstream and downstream proximal TAD regions tend to exhibit opposite trends in gene expression. Inclusion of IS, PC1, and IF in ChromHMM identifies additional "active promoters on boundaries" state. Hi-C data preprocessing - Juicer, KR normalization.

Grouped into five strategies (Table 1): linear score (Arrowhead, Armatus, CaTCH, HiTAD, matryoshka, OnTAD, Multi-CD), clustering (IC-Finder, TADpole, BHi-Cect, SpectralTAD), network features (HBM, spectral, 3DNetMod, GRiNCH), structural entropy (deDoc, SuperTAD), statistical model (TADtree, GMAP, PSYCHIC, HiKey). Similarity among TADs by average linkage, grouped into four clusters. Generally, TADs are smaller than 2Mb. Resolution affects TAD callers, SpectralTAD the most reproducible. Introduction about TADs subdivided in sub-TADs, enrichment of TAD boundaries in CTCF, cohesin, active epigenomic marks of strong enhancers, mediators, transcription factors, TSSs, TTSs. Evidence that TAD hierarchy is different from stacking Hi-C heatmaps of heterogeneous cells.

## 3D modeling

- [OpenMiChroM](https://github.com/junioreif/OpenMiChroM) - OpenMiChroM is a Python library for performing chromatin dynamics simulations. See documentation here [here](https://open-michrom.readthedocs.io/). Primarily using the [OpenMM Python API](https://openmm.org) and the [MiChroM (Minimal Chromatin Model)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1613607113) energy function, it generates an ensemble of 3D chromosomal structures consistent with experimental Hi-C maps for Human and other [organisms](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-35909-2).  OpenMiChroM offers flexibility by supporting custom energy functions and optimization procedures like direct inversion, as exemplified in the [Woolly Mammoth genome modeling](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.30.547175v1.abstract). This makes it suitable for simulations of single or multiple chromosome chains using High-Performance Computing in different platforms (GPUs and CPUs).<details>

Micro-C, nascent transcript profiling (mNET-seq), live-cell single-molecule imaging (single-particle tracking technique spaSPT. Mouse embryonic stem cells. E-P interaction strength correlates with gene expression, cohesin loop strength does not. E-P and P-P interactions can cross TAD boundaries. TADs are much more effective at insulating cohesin loops than E-P and P-P loops. CTCF depletion had minimal impact on genomewide interactions; RAD21 depletion reduced contact frequency in the range of 10 – 200 kb but increased interactions at 300 kb – 5 Mb; and WAPL depletion increased contacts at 70 – 700 kb but reduced contacts at 1 – 5 Mb.

- Micro-C (MNase digestion Hi-C) data analysis. Nucleosome-level (~100-200bp) resolution Hi-C, captures all structures in regular Hi-C data. Stripes/flames structures correspond to enhancer-promoter interactions, colocalize with PolII, CTCF. E-P stripes and domains interact with each other to form nested structures at scales of tens to hundreds of kilobases. Integrating Micro-C contact maps with 48 public genome datasets, PCA and tSNE on them to separate boundaries into different categories. Fine-scale structures exist in compartment A but not B, associated with gene structures, encompass two genes and have a flanking 5-40kb region, colocalize with CpG islands, promoters, TFBSs, fragile nucleosomes, and tRNA genes (Fig. 2e). Boundaries in the inactive compartments are colocalized with repeats. Features associated with location (Pos: CTCF & Cohesin, ATAC, H3K4me3; Neg: H3K27me3, H3K9me2, Cbx) and boundary strength (Pos: ATAC, H3K4me3, PolII, CTCF & Cohesin) (Fig. 3B,C). Enhancer-related boundaries separate in two groups, (I) cell type-specific, enriched with H3K4me1, Essrb, Nanog, and (II) constitutive, enriched with H3K27ac, Mediator, and Yy1. CTCF or cohesin, chromatin accessibility, Mediator, active histone marks, and transcription factors are all positive predictors of boundary location, while H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and CBX proteins are negative predictors of boundary location. CTCF & Cohesin are predictive of distant interactions. PolII, TFs and coactivators, and active histone modifications are predictive of short-range interactions. TADs are split into "micro TADs", subdivided into five subgroups. Two-start zig-zag model tetra-nucleosome stacks. Mouse embryonic stem cell, 38 biological replicates, merged.

- **Tri-C technology**, a 3C approach to characterize multi-way chromatin interactions at individual alleles (viewpoints). Compared with limitations of Hi-C, GAM, SPRITE. NlaIII 4-cutter restriction enzyme producing approx. 200bp fragments.
Demonstrated on the structure of the mouse globin locus (erythroid cells with active globin genes vs. embryonic stem cells with the silent globin loci). High-resolution single-allele chromatin structures do not support a model of stable loop formation between individual CTCF-binding sites but indicate a dynamic mechanism, such as loop extrusion underlying the for- mation of chromatin domains.

### Normalization

- Lyu, Hongqiang, Erhu Liu, and Zhifang Wu. "[Comparison of Normalization Methods for Hi-C Data](https://europepmc.org/article/med/31588782) BioTechniques 68, no. 2 (2020) - a comprehensive analysis of six Hi-C normalization methods for their ability to remove systematic biases. The introduction provides a good classification and overview of different normalization methods, including the latest methods for cross-sample normalization, such as [multiHiCcompare](#multihiccompare). Human and mouse Hi-C data were used, only cis interaction matrices are considered. A systematic protocol for benchmarking is presented. Several benchmarks were performed, including statistical quality, the influence of resolution, consistency of distance-dependent changes in interaction frequency, reproducibility of the 3D architecture. [multiHiCcompare](#multihiccompare) is reported as outperforming other methods on a range of performance metrics.
